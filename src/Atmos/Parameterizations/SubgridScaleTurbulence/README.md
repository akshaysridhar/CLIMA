# Module: SubgridScaleTurbulence
## Models for subgrid-scale turbulence in large-eddy simulations
----------------------------------------------------------------
Computes various parameters and tensors relevant to the computation of
subgrid-scale stresses and strains to represent turbulent process which
are unresolved at a given grid resolution
